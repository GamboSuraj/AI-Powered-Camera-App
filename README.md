## FYP Abstract üìù

<p>
Today smartphones have become the major source of digital photographs overtaking digital
cameras. Manufacturers are combining hardware and software solutions to improve camera
quality on smartphones. But still, smartphone cameras are limited in their capabilities due to
hardware restrictions. Advanced level image editing still require use of desktop software such
as Adobe Photoshop. We are using new machine learning and computer vision techniques to
improve image quality and enhance image editing experience of users on their smartphones.
Contrast enhancement and synthetic exposure fusion are used to improve image quality in low
light and high dynamic range scenarios. Computer vision techniques such as homography are
used to allow users to edit their selfies. They are able to rotate and tilt their face in image. Facial
features such as hair are edited in images with the help of CycleGAN and machine learning.
All three modules are integrated in a single android application. Android application uses image
data from camera or gallery and processes it according to module‚Äôs requirements. It either
processes image data locally or sends it to Docker based microservice deployed on Azure
platform. Processed image is then relayed back to the android application. These three modules
can also be used independently or incorporated in other applications in future.
